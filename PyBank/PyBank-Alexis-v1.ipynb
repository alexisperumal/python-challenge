    "# In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)\n",

    "#   • The average of the changes in \"Profit/Losses\" over the entire period\n",
    "#   • The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period\n",
